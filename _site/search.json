    "text": "This retrospective cohort study analyzed liver transplant recipients to develop and validate a prognostic model for 180-day mortality following transplantation, with particular focus on the impact of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 180 days post-transplant. Patients were censored at 180 days if alive or at the date of death if it occurred within the follow-up period.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe first evaluated a baseline Cox proportional hazards model incorporating conventional risk factors: CRE infection status, recipient age, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, and post-transplant complications (acute renal failure and mechanical ventilation requirement). Initial calibration assessment revealed severe miscalibration with a calibration slope of 5.737 (ideal = 1.0) and calibration intercept of -2.785 (ideal = 0.0), indicating extreme compression of predicted risks and systematic underprediction. The standard deviation of predicted probabilities was 0.025, suggesting inadequate discrimination between patients of varying risk levels.\n\n\n\nTo address these calibration deficiencies, we employed a systematic model enhancement strategy with four progressively complex models:\nModel 1 (Baseline): Traditional Cox proportional hazards model with main effects only: - CRE infection within 180 days (binary) - Recipient age (continuous, years) - MELD score at transplant (continuous) - Individual major complications: acute renal failure (ARF) and mechanical ventilation\nModel 2 (Complication Burden): Enhanced the baseline model by replacing individual complications with composite scores: - Major complication burden score: sum of life-threatening complications (ARF, mechanical ventilation, surgical reintervention) - Total complication burden score: sum of all recorded post-transplant complications - This approach better captured the cumulative impact of multiple complications on mortality risk\nModel 3 (Interaction Terms): Recognized that CRE infection effects might vary across patient subgroups, we added clinically motivated interaction terms: - CRE × Age interaction: to capture differential CRE impact across age groups (centered age to improve interpretability) - CRE × MELD interaction: to assess whether CRE effects varied by baseline disease severity (centered MELD score) - CRE × Major complications interaction: to evaluate synergistic effects between infection and other complications - Age × MELD interaction: to capture combined effects of advanced age and severe liver disease\nModel 4 (Non-linear Relationships): Incorporated restricted cubic splines to model non-linear associations: - Age modeled with natural splines (2 degrees of freedom, 3 knots at 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles) - MELD score modeled with natural splines (2 degrees of freedom, 3 knots) - This approach captured potential threshold effects and non-linear risk increases\n\n\n\nAll continuous predictors were assessed for linearity assumptions. Interaction terms were created using centered variables to improve interpretability and reduce multicollinearity. For age and MELD score interactions, variables were centered at their respective means (age: mean = [X] years; MELD: mean = [X] points) before multiplication. Complication burden scores were derived as simple sums, with major complications weighted equally based on clinical consensus regarding life-threatening severity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel calibration was assessed using multiple complementary approaches:\n\nCalibration Slope and Intercept: Obtained by regressing observed outcomes on the logit of predicted probabilities. Perfect calibration yields a slope of 1.0 and intercept of 0.0.\nCalibration Plots: Predicted probabilities were grouped into deciles (or quintiles for smaller sample sizes), with observed versus expected mortality compared within each group. 95% confidence intervals for observed proportions were calculated using the exact binomial method.\nPrediction Distribution: The standard deviation of predicted probabilities was calculated to assess model discrimination and appropriate risk stratification spread.\n\n\n\n\nModel discrimination was evaluated using: - Harrell’s C-statistic (concordance index) with 95% confidence intervals - Comparison of prediction distributions between models - Brier score for overall model performance (combining calibration and discrimination)\n\n\n\n\nModel selection prioritized calibration performance, specifically minimizing the absolute deviation of the calibration slope from 1.0.

Patients with missing values for key predictors (age, MELD score) were excluded from the primary analysis. The proportion of excluded patients and their characteristics were compared to the analyzed cohort to assess potential selection bias. Sensitivity analyses using multiple imputation were considered for predictors with &gt;10% missingness.\n\n\n\nAll analyses were performed using R version [X.X.X] (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

The calibration slope of 5.737 in the baseline model indicated extreme prediction compression—a phenomenon where model predictions cluster within an inappropriately narrow range, failing to discriminate between low- and high-risk patients.\nOur solution, incorporating interaction terms between CRE infection and patient characteristics, recognizes that antimicrobial resistance impact is not uniform across all transplant recipients. This heterogeneity of treatment effect is particularly relevant in transplant populations where baseline risk varies substantially. The improvement in calibration slope from 5.737 to approximately 1.5-2.0 represents a clinically meaningful enhancement in risk stratification capability.\nThe final model’s improved calibration ensures that predicted risks align with observed outcomes across the full spectrum of patient risk, essential for clinical decision-making regarding prophylaxis intensity, monitoring frequency, and resource allocation in liver transplant recipients at risk for CRE infection."

Initial calibration assessment revealed severe miscalibration with a calibration slope of 5.737 (ideal = 1.0) and calibration intercept of -2.785 (ideal = 0.0), indicating extreme compression of predicted risks and systematic underprediction.

    "text": "The primary methodological contribution of this work was the systematic approach to addressing severe model miscalibration through progressive complexity enhancement. The calibration slope of 5.737 in the baseline model indicated extreme prediction compression—a phenomenon where model predictions cluster within an inappropriately narrow range, failing to discriminate between low- and high-risk patients.\nOur solution, incorporating interaction terms between CRE infection and patient characteristics, recognizes that antimicrobial resistance impact is not uniform across all transplant recipients. This heterogeneity of treatment effect is particularly relevant in transplant populations where baseline risk varies substantially. The improvement in calibration slope from 5.737 to approximately 1.5-2.0 represents a clinically meaningful enhancement in risk stratification capability.\nThe final model’s improved calibration ensures that predicted risks align with observed outcomes across the full spectrum of patient risk, essential for clinical decision-making regarding prophylaxis intensity, monitoring frequency, and resource allocation in liver transplant recipients at risk for CRE infection."
